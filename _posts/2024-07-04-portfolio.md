1. Segment Anything
2. Preprocessing each frame to highlight the objects on the video, and performing contour detection

## Segment Anything 

We can take a look at the masks generated by Segment Anything on the original video side by side. 
While the mask generated is useful, getting the area of the mask is tedious as it involves concatenating the masks points sequentially, identifying as a contour and calculating the area.

We perform similar mask segmenation to see how accurately it outlines the flowers

It looks like the SAM basically isolates the foreground object and applies a red tint mask to the black background

The issues faced are as follows:
1. Processing a single video takes a lot of time and resources
2. Calculating the area under a mask requires more data manipulation, employing cv2 functions to find the area enclosed within a changing polygon that may get disjointed. 
   
## Preprocessing Images

This process proved to be less computationally intensive.
