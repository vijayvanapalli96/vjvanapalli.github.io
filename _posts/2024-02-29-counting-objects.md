## Measuring Objects in Images and Videos 

## Introduction 

I'm fascinated by videos in which tracking and counting can play a useful role in real life. For instance tracking a puppy through a dog cam to track where it's going.

Or time lapse videos where you can see how objects or people go through different states

I'm also interested in medical applications,  usually the most direct approaches of using models on images are blood cell count, identifying foreign objects in sample cultures and so on
