## Measuring Growth Rate in Objects

## Introduction 

In this blog post we will be exploring different methods to explore the growth of objects, or the changes that appear in them over time. 

This post will mainly try to explore these changes through two methods:

1. Segment Anything
2. Preprocessing each frame to highlight the objects on the video, and performing contour detection

## Segment Anything 

We can take a look at the masks generated by Segment Anything on the original video side by side. 
While the mask generated is useful, getting the area of the mask is tedious as it involves concatenating the masks points sequentially, identifying as a contour and calculating the area.

We perform similar mask segmenation to see how accurately it outlines the flowers

It looks like the SAM basically isolates the foreground object and applies a red tint mask to the black background

The issues faced are as follows:
1. Processing a single video takes a lot of time and resources
2. Calculating the area under a mask requires more data manipulation, employing cv2 functions to find the area enclosed within a changing polygon that may get disjointed. 
   
## Preprocessing Images

This process proved to be less computationally intensive.
For the same video, I thresholded the image, and used cv2s findContour function to isolate the foreground object from the blank background. The contrasting colors and the high definition video allowed me to not account of any occlusion or noise. 
The results can be seen below

Similarly we can extend this way of measuring growth to other objects. 
Crystallization is an interesting problem domain, while we can't measure the actual mass of the crystal we can at least measure the rate of growth if given the duration for which the time lapse has occured as shown below.

In the dandelion video the area change is quite significantly measured, and thus allows us to calculate growth rate.
We can apply similar constraints 
## Analysis of Results 

For the blue flower we can observe the following results, which is consistent with what we see, the growth rate does not really change much during the duration of the video after the initial spike which means we're looking at a consistent growth rate, or there isn't much noticible change

I tried to extend this analysis to other types of flowers as well :

## Analysis of Vision Algorithms
These Vision algorithms are quite fun to tweak with, as they allow you to narrow down the type of blob that you are searching for. If I wanted to target the larger white blood cells I would simply have to increase the size of the blob and zero in on the defects, however it is a nuanced parameter as red blood cells can also have large sizes, so it is not appropriate to just distinguish based on size. 
Training a model to recognize the color, shape and collection of the blood cells would be a more long standing solution.
